Our Dad Peter Glattback was born in Bishop Auckland, County Durham on the 27 th April
1951 to Gerard and Louisa Glattback of 11 Fleet Street. He had an older brother called
Michael and he also enjoyed spending time with his cousins Liz, George and John as well as
his aunt Zena and her husband John.

Jerry his dad had played piano to a high level and this skill was handed down to both Dad
and uncle Mike.

Both brothers enjoyed playing down at the local recreation ground simply known as the ‘rec’.
It was probably an opportunity too to have a sly cigarette and chat up some girls, however
dad’s mum Louie was a character not to be messed with and both Uncle Mike and Dad
made sure they were always back home well before curfew.

Dad went to Barnard Castle School (well before Barnard Castle became famous in
lockdown), excelling in music, maths and languages and he progressed onto Leeds
Polytechnic to study Russian and French. However he soon quit his studies moved to
London and started what would be a long and fruitful career working for customs and excise
in the early 1970s.

By now, Dad’s older brother, Uncle Mike had been in Birmingham for a number of years and
dad got on really well with Sue, Uncle Mike’s partner, who would spend a lot of time in
Bishop Auckland with Nan and Grandad.

It was on a visit home from London to Bishop Auckland one weekend, that he met his future
wife Glynis (my mum) in the Wear Valley pub. They both knew a mutual friend and chatted
happily all evening. Dad capitalised the next day when he realised that they were both on the
same train home and he persuaded mum to give him her details. Dad stayed in London
while Mum worked in Hull and eventually she relocated down to work in Hertfordshire and
they were married in 1974. They lodged in a single room in a house in Gammons Lane,
Watford rented from an old woman. Not too long after this Dad got a promotion to the
Newcastle Customs office and they returned back up north.

They lived in Newcastle and then I was born in 1976 and not long after we moved down to
Baildon in West Yorkshire as Dad had now taken up yet another role at the Leeds customs
office. In February 1981 my sister and Dad’s only daughter Katie was born but not too long
after this mum and dad separated in fact at this point dad had already transferred back to
London where he continued developing his career.

Although he was working hard, Dad still enjoyed going out in his free time and he met
Carolyn at a bar in Wanstead helping her onto a stool which she was having difficulty getting
onto. Dad told Carolyn he loved cantering over the moors on horseback (a clear lie as
Carolyn later found out) however this chat up line worked as Dad and Carolyn were married
in 1984. They loved visiting beautiful places together including County Durham, Yorkshire,
Devon, Cornwall , Somerset and shorter trips out to Oxford and Cambridge for the weekend.

The highlight however was a trip to the island of Rhodes where the mode of transport was a
moped around the countryside, both Carolyn and Dad getting badly sunburnt in the process.
There were also many trips to France where Dad would converse in French at the bar while
Carolyn had no idea what he was saying which he used to find highly amusing.

The happy newlywed couple lived in Woodford Green, Essex and Dad was welcomed into
Carolyn’s large family by Carolyn’s parents John and Margaret and Carolyn’s siblings Jill,
Bruce and Rosemary and by Carolyn’s brother in law Gary and sister in law Linda.

Although Dad used to jokingly grumble about the number of hugs, kisses and handshakes
that had to be exchanged at the frequent family gatherings, he really enjoyed the company
of Carolyn’s family and often if we were lucky Kate and I would join these gatherings in the
school holidays when we visited Dad and Carolyn.

We would often meet him half way between Essex and Yorkshire and the first thing he would
do after picking us up would be to light a cigar with all the passive smoke wafting onto the
back seats, this was the 1980s after all and secretly we loved the trademark smell! He also
loved folk music and we knew we had to endure an hour or so of wailing voices and fiddles
as he inevitably switched off a popular chart song on the radio to replace it with a cassette of
some Anglo/Irish musical mayhem.

On New Years Day in 1989 we got the brilliant news that our brother, Mark had been born,
soon followed by Tom in November 1990. Dad was quickly catapulted into the role of Footy
dad and coach as both Mark and Thomas played to a good standard notably for Buckhurst
Hill. Although most coaches don a tracksuit and football boots, not dad who would carry out
the task with his trademark Hamlet cigar wearing his casual leather jacket, slip on shoes and
a pair of jeans, not getting too excited on the sidelines.

On one occasion Mark’s team were due to play a team with a reputation for being rough and
tough in the local area. Much to Mark’s relief the game was due to be cancelled when the
referee didn’t turn up only for dad to step in and offer to ref the game much to the dismay of
Mark, but dad carried out the task with a calm head, which must have served him well during
years of investigation work.

Dad loved driving up the standards of schoolwork but his general approach was one of
patience particularly when Mark was preparing to take his 11 plus. Mark remembers a story
where Dad had asked Mark to write a hyphen to which Mark responded ‘how do you spell
hyphen Dad?’.

Tom remembers that Dad, Carolyn and the boys would travel to France for holidays and dad
would continue to show off his excellent language skills, he also remembers the wide variety
of books that dad used to read, especially crime novels. Tom points out that Dad’s favourite
chocolate was always a Toblerone and he used to love eating curries (Tom actually said
Dad liked Indians - I believe as a modern non-racist man Dad did indeed like people from
India however I think what Tom meant is that dad liked curries!).

By the turn of the century Dad moved into his own flat in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire and he
spent a lot of time with his ex-colleague from customs Larry and Mick whom he met at the
Bull pub and who became his best friend.

Dad’s career in Customs judging from the number of colleagues who have contacted us,
appears be have been pretty legendary although outwardly apart from putting us kids into
the odd thumb lock or trying to teach us a bit of advanced driving, dad didn’t really talk about
his career too much. He was very modest. His career spanned four decades and he worked
in numerous offices around the country but predominantly in London, including Customs
House on the edge of the Thames and King George V Docks at City Airport.

Dad’s nickname in customs was ‘Gladys’ and his colleagues have recounted his kindness,
compassion, professionalism and dry wit and charm which combined with his soft Durham
accent made him a popular member of the various teams he was in. I am sure you could
write a book about dad’s career in customs and excise and hearing these messages has
truly made Mark, Tom, Katie and I truly proud of what he achieved.

A few years later Dad stepped into the danger zone when he spent several years working in
Kabul, Afghanistan. It was a very dangerous environment and on one occasion in Kabul, a
car bomb exploded in a spot that dad had walked past a few seconds before, he was
shielded from it by just one building but in classic dad fashion it didn’t faze him and he
carried on focussing on the job.

One of Tom’s favourite memories was a story that dad told him of a dream that dad had
while in his room at the complex in Kabul. He dreamt that he was confronting a terrorist and
kicked a gun out of his hand, only to wake up in a lot of pain and realise he’d actually kicked
his wardrobe and broken his toe – he had to be flown back to the UK for treatment! It was a
stark reminder that although this particular dream may have been a bit exaggerated, the job
he did put him in frequent danger.

At the end of his stint in Afghanistan retirement was looming. Dad had started to visit the
seaside town of St Ives in Cornwall aided by the knowledge that he had several ex customs
friends living down there. 3 days after retiring Dad made the snap decision to re-locate away
from the South-East down to St Ives to start the next adventure in his life.
Not long after moving to Cornwall dad was awarded with a service medal which he proudly
kept in the House in St Ives. He was meant to go up to London to collect it from the Right
Honourable William Hague but predictably dad declined saying he wasn’t going to travel all
the way up to London just for a poxy handshake and photo opportunity with a politician and
he went to the pub instead.

The St Ives ex customs fraternity centred on the Beachcomber café run by an ex customs
officer David. It was in the Beachcomber that Dad met Angela and he soon moved into
Angela’s house in Trenwith Place with beautiful views over the harbour.

Although in the early days there are rare photos of dad in a wetsuit getting involved in the
Cornish lifestyle, Dad soon established a fairly rigid routine which centred on a lunchtime
visit to the pub, incorporating an afternoon nap before returning for a late afternoon/early
evening session. Mick recounts a story where he was sitting in the flat in Broxbourne looking
at the St Ives webcam and there was dad sitting outside the Sloop pub with an empty glass
for several minutes. Mick picked up the phone and called dad, and told him to stop messing
around and get himself to the bar which to which dad obliged.

Dad made many friends down in St Ives and had a wonderful relationship with Angela’s
daughter Geri and her two daughters Liv and Grace. In Geri’s words, Angela’s life exploded
in the most brilliant way when she and dad met.

Trenwith Place, just off the walk from the main car park into the centre of St Ives would have
a regular stream of visitors popping in. By now Dad had two grandchildren Hanna and Luke
and a daughter in law Jo who he loved seeing when they would pop in in the summer
months.

Katie now living in Cyprus also had two more grandchildren Jackson and Kobe with her
husband Jonathan who dad loved to see albeit less often. Dad and Angela loved it when
Mark and Marie and Tom and Amy visited from Essex and dad would give them all a tour of
the St Ives pubs. Tom did however recount that it was difficult to sleep in St Ives due to
Dad’s excessive snoring and the constant rumbling of his oxygen machine!

Dad was also involved in the local St Ives Parish church committee and took great pleasure
in showing family members and visitors the church and in particular the clock tower with a
clock that always seemed in need of fixing.

Although Dad was ever charming and popular, he always had an apt selection of expletives
to describe those fellow committee members whom he believed took the job too seriously
and who he considered ‘jobsworths’ - one of his pet hates.

As Dads health started to suffer he had to adapt his lifestyle quickly. However people who
know Dad well will not be surprised to learn that this didn’t stop his daily visits to the pub,
where he would employ his aforementioned Maths skills and carefully calculate sufficient
Oxygen levels to give him a couple of hours drinking time before getting a taxi for the very
short journey up the hill.

Dad was very proud when he was able to attend Mark’s wedding to Marie as he was with
Katie and Jonathan’s wedding a few years before and he happily introduced Angela to the
members of his ‘Essex’ family. Dad was truly heartbroken when Angela fell ill and he
returned to Broxbourne. The song Ave Maria was a joint favourite of Dad and Angela’s and it
was played at Angela’s funeral and it was the music we heard as we came in today.

Dad was lucky to have Mick with him in the flat in Broxbourne, Mick could also write another
book about Dad’s exploits. Dad now much less mobile still had the cheeky confidence to
send Mick out on various errands to the petrol station. Mick remembers that Dad would
frequently encourage him to order a kebab, not through concern that Mick might be hungry
but from the point of view that the takeaway in question delivered to your door if you ordered
two kebabs or more.

Although Dad was struggling more to move around in the final years of his life, he loved
seeing his granddaughter Rene who he described as a ‘bright spark’, ‘a character’ and a
‘Ray of Sunshine’ high praise indeed coming from dad and he was really proud only a few
months ago when young Charlie was born and he appreciated the Video calls where he got
chance to speak to him.

No doubt dad will already be sitting at the bar in Heaven re-united with all the people up
there that he knew and loved. He’ll be putting the world to rights and making them all laugh
with his charming smile.

I spoke to Geri, Angela’s daughter just yesterday and she sums up our feelings towards
Dad’s when she said:

We all adored Pete
We loved him to death
He was always kind.

Kate my sister who is currently in North Carolina had exchanged messages some time ago
with dad when he told her his favourite poem was by a 15 th Century Astronomer to his pupil -
it simply reads:

Though my soul may set in darkness
It will rise in perfect light
I have loved the stars too fondly
To be frightened of the night

Dad we love you. Rest in peace xxx
